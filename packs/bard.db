Teleportation effects can pass through the barrier, as can visual effects (since the wall is invisible).

A spectral omen of disaster appears above the target's head- traditionally, this is a downward-pointing sword, but some spellcasters report seeing a hangman's noose or a grinning skull instead. When you Cast this Spell, pick one of the following triggers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The target moves more than its Speed in a single round.</li>\n<li>The target makes more than one Strike in a single round.</li>\n<li>The target Casts a Spell.</li>\n<li>The target uses a specific skill you name.</li>\n<li>The target uses a specific ability you name.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the target takes the triggering action, the portent of doom activates-the sword strikes down, the noose loops around the target's neck, the skull bares its fangs-and the target takes [[/r 70[mental]]] damage with a basic Reflex save. The target instinctively knows which action will trigger the omen and can ward off the omen by spending a total of 3 actions, which have the concentrate trait, to pray, make signs against doom, or similar apotropaic actions. These actions need not be consecutive. After the creature spends the actions, the spell ends.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage increases by 10.</p>"},"source":{"value":"Pathfinder Dark Archive"},"traits":{"value":["curse","mental","prediction"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":"suspended-retribution","schema":{"version":0.815,"lastMigration":null},"level":{"value":6},"spellType":{"value":"save"},"category":{"value":"spell"},"traditions":{"value":["divine","occult"],"custom":""},"school":{"value":"divination"},"components":{"focus":false,"material":false,"somatic":true,"verbal":true},"materials":{"value":""},"target":{"value":"1 creature"},"range":{"value":"60 feet"},"area":null,"time":{"value":"2"},"duration":{"value":"1 minute"},"damage":{"value":{}},"save":{"value":"reflex","basic":"basic"},"sustained":{"value":false},"cost":{"value":""},"ability":{"value":""},"location":{"value":"OngFtzoe22VvIJue","heightenedLevel":6},"hasCounteractCheck":{"value":false},"heightening":{"damage":{},"interval":1,"type":"interval"}},"type":"spell","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.k0qJfSZH5xUEggwU"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":2300000,"ownership":{"default":0,"aTWxsSrAlxp06IfB":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.6.8","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1674663645702,"modifiedTime":1674678668629,"lastModifiedBy":"aTWxsSrAlxp06IfB"},"_id":"tIYADMSLLhOIYMJz"},{"img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/systems/pf2e/assets/icons/spells/wall-of-force.webp","name":"Wall of Force","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>You form an @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.zJxUflt9np0q4yML]{Invisible} wall of pure magical force up to 50 feet long and up to 20 feet high.

The wall is straight and vertical, stretching 60 feet long and 30 feet high. You must form the wall in an unbroken open space so its edges don't pass through any creatures or objects, or the spell is lost. You can pass through the wall and ignore its effects. The wall sheds bright light out to 20 feet on each side (and dim light to the next 20 feet). Creatures other than you that come into the wall's light must attempt a Will save; they're @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.TkIyaNPgTZFBCCuh]{Dazzled} for 1 round on a success, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.XgEqL1kFApUbl5Z2]{Blinded} for 1 round on a failure, and Blinded for 1 minute on a critical failure. They are then temporarily immune to the blinding effect for 1 hour.</p>\n<p>A prismatic wall has seven different layers, each a different color. Red, orange, yellow, and green have the effect of a 5th-level <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.forsqeofEszBNtLq]{Chromatic Wall}</em> spell of that color, and the others have the effect of a 7th-level Chromatic Wall spell of that color. A creature that tries to pass through the wall must attempt a saving throw against each component wall. The effects take place simultaneously, so a creature turned to stone by the blue wall is still treated as a creature for the indigo and violet walls.</p>\n<p>The wall as a whole is immune to counteracting effects of the wall's level or lower; each color must be counteracted by its specific spell, as described in chromatic wall. This must be done in order (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, then violet). A given color can't be affected until the previous color is counteracted. Counteracting a color wall removes that color's effect from the wall, and counteracting them all ends prismatic wall.

The effects take place simultaneously, so a creature turned to stone by the blue wall is still treated as a creature for the indigo and violet walls.</p>\n<p>The wall as a whole is immune to counteracting effects of the wall's level or lower; each color must be counteracted by its specific spell, as described in chromatic wall. This must be done in order (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, then violet). A given color can't be affected until the previous color is counteracted. Counteracting a color wall removes that color's effect from the wall, and counteracting them all ends prismatic wall.

A spectral omen of disaster appears above the target's head- traditionally, this is a downward-pointing sword, but some spellcasters report seeing a hangman's noose or a grinning skull instead. When you Cast this Spell, pick one of the following triggers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The target moves more than its Speed in a single round.</li>\n<li>The target makes more than one Strike in a single round.</li>\n<li>The target Casts a Spell.</li>\n<li>The target uses a specific skill you name.</li>\n<li>The target uses a specific ability you name.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the target takes the triggering action, the portent of doom activates-the sword strikes down, the noose loops around the target's neck, the skull bares its fangs-and the target takes [[/r 70[mental]]] damage with a basic Reflex save. The target instinctively knows which action will trigger the omen and can ward off the omen by spending a total of 3 actions, which have the concentrate trait, to pray, make signs against doom, or similar apotropaic actions. These actions need not be consecutive. After the creature spends the actions, the spell ends.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage increases by 10.</p>"},"source":{"value":"Pathfinder Dark Archive"},"rules":[],"slug":"suspended-retribution","schema":{"version":0.815,"lastMigration":null},"traits":{"value":["curse","mental","prediction"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"level":{"value":6},"spellType":{"value":"save"},"category":{"value":"spell"},"traditions":{"value":["divine","occult"],"custom":""},"school":{"value":"divination"},"components":{"focus":false,"material":false,"somatic":true,"verbal":true},"materials":{"value":""},"target":{"value":"1 creature"},"range":{"value":"60 feet"},"area":null,"time":{"value":"2"},"duration":{"value":"1 minute"},"damage":{"value":{}},"save":{"value":"reflex","basic":"basic"},"sustained":{"value":false},"cost":{"value":""},"location":{"value":"OngFtzoe22VvIJue","heightenedLevel":6},"hasCounteractCheck":{"value":false},"ability":{"value":""},"heightening":{"damage":{},"interval":1,"type":"interval"}},"type":"spell","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.k0qJfSZH5xUEggwU"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":2300000,"ownership":{"default":0,"aTWxsSrAlxp06IfB":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.6.8","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1674663645702,"modifiedTime":1674678668629,"lastModifiedBy":"aTWxsSrAlxp06IfB"},"_id":"tIYADMSLLhOIYMJz"},{"img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/systems/pf2e/assets/icons/spells/wall-of-force.webp","name":"Wall of Force","system":{"description":{"gm":"","value":"<p>You form an @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.zJxUflt9np0q4yML]{Invisible} wall of pure magical force up to 50 feet long and up to 20 feet high.
