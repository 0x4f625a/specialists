For example, a property that must be applied to a slashing weapon wouldn't function when you attacked with a fist, but you would gain its benefits if you attacked with a claw or some other slashing unarmed attack.</p>"},"source":{"value":"Pathfinder Core Rulebook"},"rules":[],"slug":"handwraps-of-mighty-blows","schema":{"version":0.819,"lastMigration":null},"level":{"value":2},"traits":{"value":["agile","finesse","invested","magical","nonlethal","transmutation","unarmed"],"rarity":"common","otherTags":[],"custom":""},"quantity":1,"baseItem":null,"hp":{"brokenThreshold":0,"value":0,"max":0},"hardness":0,"weight":{"value":"-"},"equippedBulk":{"value":""},"price":{"value":{"gp":35}},"equipped":{"carryType":"worn","invested":null,"handsHeld":0,"inSlot":false},"stackGroup":null,"negateBulk":{"value":"0"},"containerId":null,"preciousMaterial":{"value":null},"preciousMaterialGrade":{"value":null},"size":"med","identification":{"status":"identified","unidentified":{"name":"Unusual Brawling","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/unidentified_item_icons/weapon.webp","data":{"description":{"value":""}}},"misidentified":{}},"usage":{"value":"worngloves"},"category":"unarmed","group":"brawling","bonus":{"value":1},"damage":{"dice":1,"die":"d4","damageType":"bludgeoning","persistent":null},"bonusDamage":{"value":0},"splashDamage":{"value":0},"range":null,"reload":{"value":""},"MAP":{"value":""},"potencyRune":{"value":1},"strikingRune":{"value":"striking"},"specific":{"value":false},"propertyRune1":{"value":null},"propertyRune2":{"value":null},"propertyRune3":{"value":null},"propertyRune4":{"value":null},"property1":{"value":"","dice":0,"die":"","damageType":"","critDice":0,"critDie":"","critDamage":"","critDamageType":"","strikeConditionType":"","strikeConditionValue":null,"criticalConditionType":"","criticalConditionValue":null}},"type":"weapon","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.FNDq4NFSN0g2HKWO"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"aTWxsSrAlxp06IfB":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.7.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1677349044649,"modifiedTime":1677360620512,"lastModifiedBy":"aTWxsSrAlxp06IfB"},"_id":"SL4OJYXnptAzeSKC"}],"effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Actor.xxp1bJfYEoRTKCvy"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.7.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1677347020099,"modifiedTime":1677360845490,"lastModifiedBy":"aTWxsSrAlxp06IfB"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"aFGr225CvCqaKwVi"}

For example, a property that must be applied to a slashing weapon wouldn't function when you attacked with a fist, but you would gain its benefits if you attacked with a claw or some other slashing unarmed attack.</p>"},"source":{"value":"Pathfinder Core Rulebook"},"rules":[],"slug":"handwraps-of-mighty-blows","schema":{"version":0.819,"lastMigration":null},"level":{"value":2},"traits":{"value":["agile","finesse","invested","magical","nonlethal","transmutation","unarmed"],"rarity":"common","otherTags":[],"custom":""},"quantity":1,"baseItem":null,"hp":{"brokenThreshold":0,"value":0,"max":0},"hardness":0,"weight":{"value":"-"},"equippedBulk":{"value":""},"price":{"value":{"gp":35}},"equipped":{"carryType":"worn","invested":null,"handsHeld":0,"inSlot":false},"stackGroup":null,"negateBulk":{"value":"0"},"containerId":null,"preciousMaterial":{"value":null},"preciousMaterialGrade":{"value":null},"size":"med","identification":{"status":"identified","unidentified":{"name":"Unusual Brawling","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/unidentified_item_icons/weapon.webp","data":{"description":{"value":""}}},"misidentified":{}},"usage":{"value":"worngloves"},"category":"unarmed","group":"brawling","bonus":{"value":1},"damage":{"dice":1,"die":"d4","damageType":"bludgeoning","persistent":null},"bonusDamage":{"value":0},"splashDamage":{"value":0},"range":null,"reload":{"value":""},"MAP":{"value":""},"potencyRune":{"value":1},"strikingRune":{"value":null},"specific":{"value":false},"propertyRune1":{"value":null},"propertyRune2":{"value":null},"propertyRune3":{"value":null},"propertyRune4":{"value":null},"property1":{"value":"","dice":0,"die":"","damageType":"","critDice":0,"critDie":"","critDamage":"","critDamageType":"","strikeConditionType":"","strikeConditionValue":null,"criticalConditionType":"","criticalConditionValue":null}},"type":"weapon","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.FNDq4NFSN0g2HKWO"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"aTWxsSrAlxp06IfB":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.7.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1677349044649,"modifiedTime":1677349078361,"lastModifiedBy":"aTWxsSrAlxp06IfB"},"_id":"SL4OJYXnptAzeSKC"},{"name":"Dragon's Roar","type":"action","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The monk bellows, instilling fear in their enemies.

For example, a property that must be applied to a slashing weapon wouldn't function when you attacked with a fist, but you would gain its benefits if you attacked with a claw or some other slashing unarmed attack.</p>"},"source":{"value":"Pathfinder Core Rulebook"},"rules":[],"slug":"handwraps-of-mighty-blows","schema":{"version":0.819,"lastMigration":null},"level":{"value":2},"traits":{"value":["agile","finesse","invested","magical","nonlethal","transmutation","unarmed"],"rarity":"common","otherTags":[],"custom":""},"quantity":1,"baseItem":null,"hp":{"brokenThreshold":0,"value":0,"max":0},"hardness":0,"weight":{"value":"-"},"equippedBulk":{"value":""},"price":{"value":{"gp":35}},"equipped":{"carryType":"worn","invested":null,"handsHeld":0,"inSlot":false},"stackGroup":null,"negateBulk":{"value":"0"},"containerId":null,"preciousMaterial":{"value":null},"preciousMaterialGrade":{"value":null},"size":"med","identification":{"status":"identified","unidentified":{"name":"Unusual Brawling","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/unidentified_item_icons/weapon.webp","data":{"description":{"value":""}}},"misidentified":{}},"usage":{"value":"worngloves"},"category":"unarmed","group":"brawling","bonus":{"value":1},"damage":{"dice":1,"die":"d4","damageType":"bludgeoning","persistent":null},"bonusDamage":{"value":0},"splashDamage":{"value":0},"range":null,"reload":{"value":""},"MAP":{"value":""},"potencyRune":{"value":1},"strikingRune":{"value":"striking"},"specific":{"value":false},"propertyRune1":{"value":null},"propertyRune2":{"value":null},"propertyRune3":{"value":null},"propertyRune4":{"value":null},"property1":{"value":"","dice":0,"die":"","damageType":"","critDice":0,"critDie":"","critDamage":"","critDamageType":"","strikeConditionType":"","strikeConditionValue":null,"criticalConditionType":"","criticalConditionValue":null}},"type":"weapon","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.FNDq4NFSN0g2HKWO"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"aTWxsSrAlxp06IfB":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.7.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1677349044649,"modifiedTime":1677360620512,"lastModifiedBy":"aTWxsSrAlxp06IfB"},"_id":"SL4OJYXnptAzeSKC"},{"name":"Blazing Talon Surge","type":"action","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The monk rushes forward and latches onto their enemy with talons of hungering fire.

For example, a property that must be applied to a slashing weapon wouldn't function when you attacked with a fist, but you would gain its benefits if you attacked with a claw or some other slashing unarmed attack.</p>"},"source":{"value":"Pathfinder Core Rulebook"},"rules":[],"slug":"handwraps-of-mighty-blows","schema":{"version":0.819,"lastMigration":null},"level":{"value":2},"traits":{"value":["agile","finesse","invested","magical","nonlethal","transmutation","unarmed"],"rarity":"common","otherTags":[],"custom":""},"quantity":1,"baseItem":null,"hp":{"brokenThreshold":0,"value":0,"max":0},"hardness":0,"weight":{"value":"-"},"equippedBulk":{"value":""},"price":{"value":{"gp":35}},"equipped":{"carryType":"worn","invested":null,"handsHeld":0,"inSlot":false},"stackGroup":null,"negateBulk":{"value":"0"},"containerId":null,"preciousMaterial":{"value":null},"preciousMaterialGrade":{"value":null},"size":"med","identification":{"status":"identified","unidentified":{"name":"Unusual Brawling","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/unidentified_item_icons/weapon.webp","data":{"description":{"value":""}}},"misidentified":{}},"usage":{"value":"worngloves"},"category":"unarmed","group":"brawling","bonus":{"value":1},"damage":{"dice":1,"die":"d4","damageType":"bludgeoning","persistent":null},"bonusDamage":{"value":0},"splashDamage":{"value":0},"range":null,"reload":{"value":""},"MAP":{"value":""},"potencyRune":{"value":2},"strikingRune":{"value":"greaterStriking"},"specific":{"value":false},"propertyRune1":{"value":null},"propertyRune2":{"value":null},"propertyRune3":{"value":null},"propertyRune4":{"value":null},"property1":{"value":"","dice":0,"die":"","damageType":"","critDice":0,"critDie":"","critDamage":"","critDamageType":"","strikeConditionType":"","strikeConditionValue":null,"criticalConditionType":"","criticalConditionValue":null}},"type":"weapon","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.FNDq4NFSN0g2HKWO"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"aTWxsSrAlxp06IfB":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.7.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1677349044649,"modifiedTime":1677373362313,"lastModifiedBy":"aTWxsSrAlxp06IfB"},"_id":"SL4OJYXnptAzeSKC"},{"name":"Flinging Blow","type":"action","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The monk takes a moment to centre themselves, then unleash a powerful blow that sends their target tumbling away.

For example, a property that must be applied to a slashing weapon wouldn't function when you attacked with a fist, but you would gain its benefits if you attacked with a claw or some other slashing unarmed attack.</p>"},"source":{"value":"Pathfinder Core Rulebook"},"rules":[],"slug":"handwraps-of-mighty-blows","schema":{"version":0.819,"lastMigration":null},"level":{"value":2},"traits":{"value":["agile","finesse","invested","magical","nonlethal","transmutation","unarmed"],"rarity":"common","otherTags":[],"custom":""},"quantity":1,"baseItem":null,"hp":{"brokenThreshold":0,"value":0,"max":0},"hardness":0,"weight":{"value":"-"},"equippedBulk":{"value":""},"price":{"value":{"gp":35}},"equipped":{"carryType":"worn","invested":null,"handsHeld":0,"inSlot":false},"stackGroup":null,"negateBulk":{"value":"0"},"containerId":null,"preciousMaterial":{"value":null},"preciousMaterialGrade":{"value":null},"size":"med","identification":{"status":"identified","unidentified":{"name":"Unusual Brawling","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/unidentified_item_icons/weapon.webp","data":{"description":{"value":""}}},"misidentified":{}},"usage":{"value":"worngloves"},"category":"unarmed","group":"brawling","bonus":{"value":1},"damage":{"dice":1,"die":"d4","damageType":"bludgeoning","persistent":null},"bonusDamage":{"value":0},"splashDamage":{"value":0},"range":null,"reload":{"value":""},"MAP":{"value":""},"potencyRune":{"value":2},"strikingRune":{"value":"greaterStriking"},"specific":{"value":false},"propertyRune1":{"value":null},"propertyRune2":{"value":null},"propertyRune3":{"value":null},"propertyRune4":{"value":null},"property1":{"value":"","dice":0,"die":"","damageType":"","critDice":0,"critDie":"","critDamage":"","critDamageType":"","strikeConditionType":"","strikeConditionValue":null,"criticalConditionType":"","criticalConditionValue":null}},"type":"weapon","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.FNDq4NFSN0g2HKWO"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"aTWxsSrAlxp06IfB":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.7.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1677349044649,"modifiedTime":1677373362313,"lastModifiedBy":"aTWxsSrAlxp06IfB"},"_id":"SL4OJYXnptAzeSKC"},{"name":"Flinging Blow","type":"action","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The monk takes a moment to centre themselves, then unleash a powerful blow that sends their target tumbling away.
